    <p>
        As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, <br>
        returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.<br>
<br>
        The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).<br>
<br>
        For example:<br>
<br>
        gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0<br>
        2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.<br>
<br>
        Another example (just to make sure it is clear):<br>
<br>
        gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1<br>
        10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.<br>
    </p>
